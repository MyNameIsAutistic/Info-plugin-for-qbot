# README
# This is a plugin for qbot.
# This will only work with qbot, or bots that are heavily based off of qbot.
# This plugin is intended for making info about the bot. If you want, you may modify the code to make your own plugin.

# INSTALLATION
# To install, all you need to do is:
# Create a file in the commands folder called info.js
# Paste the code that is found in the info.js file that I have put on this repository into the newly created info.js file.
# Replace the code that says PUT BOT INFO HERE with your own info.
# You have installed it!
